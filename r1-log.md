### R1D1 
I am doing a MERN app called DevMeetup. Apparently you can't use capital letters when you create-react-app. I installed my dependencies: axios, express, mongoose, nodemon, body-parser, react-bootstrap, react-modal, react-router-dom. Followed instructions here: https://blog.cloudboost.io/creating-your-first-mern-stack-application-b6604d12e4d3.
